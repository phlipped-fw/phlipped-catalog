# Sub-GHz fixed-code replay

Garage door openers, building perimeter gates, and many low-cost remotes built before the 2000s still use fixed-code OOK/ASK modulation on 315/433/868 MHz with no rolling code or authentication. A capture-and-replay attack with a Flipper Zero takes under 10 seconds and works at meaningful distance.

## Attack chain

1. Attacker idles within RF range while a legitimate user opens the gate.
2. Flipper captures the burst on 433.92 / 868 MHz.
3. Replay later, at will, from outside the immediate property line.

## Why it matters

Property breaches via sub-GHz replay are under-investigated because the physical entry leaves no electronic trail at the gate controller, only the open/close event. Insurance and CCTV review become the only forensic surface.

## Defensive layers

- Detection: `PHL-D-004` — out-of-pattern activation events correlated with no tenant credential.
- Prevent: replace fixed-code receivers with rolling-code (KeeLoq with secure session keys, AES-128 systems like Faac SLH or Came Hormann ProxiMity).
- Respond: incident playbook treats sub-GHz replay as physical intrusion; rotate codes if hardware supports it.
